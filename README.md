A junior software portfolio
I am an aspiring Softwware Engineer and Graphic Designer. I have a good knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, a basic understanding of Node.js and HTTP. 


I am currently working on an ongoing project, a full stack telemedicine application that allows patients create and manage their accounts and profiles, doctors can manage their schedules, appointments can be booked. Admistrators can also manage their systems, and so on.
