            <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
            <br><br>
            <p> I am a confident and committed Web Developer, an aspiring Software Engineer and Graphic Designer. 
                An educator of computer science. 
                A learner at Power Learn Project Africa Community 
                and TEFEM Africa Fellowship. 
                Currently, I have a good understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaSript and SQL. As well as the basics of HTTP  and Node.js.
                Curiosity attracted me to software engineering, 
                I was always curious on 
                how websites are designed to function, 
                and how they interact with the users, 
                curious on how one can differentiate between a good design
                 and a bad design.
